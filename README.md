**Self-Notes**
> how to *uneject* react app... ( restore to previous state -  because you wanted to take a look a the generated stuff from eject)
- before runing `npm run eject` - back up every on git.
- eject your app and take a look at what was generated.
-  all good ? next `git stash && git pull` get your nice react project
- `rm -r config scripts` to remove untrack folders generated by the eject script
- `npm prune` remove all the extraneous package added by eject
- `npm install` reinstall all your packages.

> != vs !== 
- the former does implicit type conversions while the latter doesn't
- USE THE LATTER! 

**Dev Stack**

**would be nice to have**
vcode -> a project previewer which renders your project in a .5 opacity window always on top of your code for live update without leaving the editor
