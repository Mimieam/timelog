## progress..
**Step 1**
- integrate redux, react-router.
- try out that eject script  - looks nice... 


**Self-Notes**
> how to *uneject* react app... ( restore to previous state -  because you wanted to take a look a the generated stuff from eject)
- before runing `npm run eject` - back up every on git.
- eject your app and take a look at what was generated.
-  all good ? next `git stash && git pull` get your nice react project
- `rm -r config scripts` to remove untrack folders generated by the eject script
- `npm prune` remove all the extraneous package added by eject
- `npm install` reinstall all your packages.


**Dev Stack**

**would be nice to have**
vcode -> a project previewer which renders your project in a .5 opacity window always on top of your code for live update without leaving the editor
